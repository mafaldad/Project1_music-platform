**Project Description**
This project aims to analyze and compare the music preferences of listeners in two cities, Springfield and Shelbyville, using data from Y.Music. In this analysis, we will test several hypotheses related to differences in music preferences based on the day of the week, time of day, and the listener's city of residence.

**Hypotheses**
1. User activity varies depending on the day of the week and the city.
2. On Monday mornings, residents of Springfield and Shelbyville listen to different genres. The same is true for Friday nights.
3. Listeners in Springfield and Shelbyville have different music preferences. In Springfield, users prefer pop music, while in Shelbyville, rap music has more fans.

**Data Description**
The data used in this project is stored in the file music_project_en.csv. 
This file contains information about the songs played by users in both cities. Below is the description of the columns in the dataset:

* userID: User ID
* Track: Song title
* artist: Artist name
* genre: Music genre
* City: User's city of residence
* time: Time the song was played
* Day: Day of the week

**Project Structure**
